## NeuraAgentix AI

Autonomous Intelligence | Agentic Systems | Green AI

NeuraAgentix AI is a research-driven innovation lab developing AI agents, agentic workflows, cyber-physical intelligence, and next-generation autonomous systems.
> “Building cognitive agents that think, act, and evolve.”

## What We Build
We design technologies at the intersection of LLMs, reinforcement learning, and cyber-physical systems:
- AI agents for complex, real-world environments
- Open-source tools for planning, reasoning, and autonomous workflows
- Publish research-driven content on AI tools, methods, and emerging trends
- Research explainers, technical deep dives, and educational content
- Teach through tutorials, demos, and YouTube videos

Our work spans autonomous systems, CPS intelligence, smart energy, Green AI, and practical agent engineering.
